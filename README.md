### Setup

As usual, you need NodeJS installed, you can install packages through ``npm i`` or on online pterodactyl hosts by uploading the package.json to the container directory.

You must first enter your shared guildId (server ID) in [./config.json](config.json), then you must enter your tokens in [./tokens.txt](tokens.txt). 
You can start it with ``node index.js``, you can also try ``node newIndex.js``, but this has not been tested properly
